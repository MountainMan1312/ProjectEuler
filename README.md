# ProjectEuler

This project contains my solutions to the problems presented by [The Euler Project](https://projecteuler.net/).

## Expansions to Project Euler

Instead of doing each problem in isolation, I decided to turn this into a whole program. So far, I've added the following functionality:
* Test for correct answer
* Execution-time measurement

I plan on adding even more:
* Expand execution-time measurement to calculate average time over several runs
* Expand execution-time measurement to test for a reasonable time (1 minute as suggested by Project Euler)
* Add functionality for multiple algorithm submissions to each problem
* Add multithreading for faster overall program completion once many problems are complete.
